This Beginner Project is designed to practice my HTML, CSS and JS skills. The project consist on a Basic Tribute Page, in this case, for my favorite actor: Denzel Hayes Washington, Jr.

The project will consist of three files:

- The Main HTML file: it will be the skeleton of the project. (Main.html)
- The CSS file: containing all the style code for the main file. (Style.css)
- The JS file: containing every possible interaction code. (Script.js)
